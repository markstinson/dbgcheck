# dbgcheck

*Check your C before you wreck your C.*

The dbgcheck library addresses the most difficult aspects of
debugging C code: memory and threading issues.

In particular, dbgcheck helps to avoid and isolate the following types of problems:
* buffer overflows,
* use of freed or unallocated memory,
* double-freeing memory,
* double-lock-acquiring,
* double-lock-freeing, and
* unsafe concurrency.

These are achieved by wrapping your calls to memory management and threading functions with
`dbgcheck`-defined macros. You do *not* need to wrap these throughout the code - isolated uses
are fine. You also do not need to use any specific `malloc` implementation.

The best part about `dbgcheck` is that you can turn it off at compile-time so that it adds
absolutely zero overhead to the runtime efficiency of your application in production.
The idea here is to test thoroughly with `dbgcheck` turned on, using it to isolate and eliminate
bugs -- then turn it off in production if application speed is critical.

When `dbgcheck` finds an error, it reports the specific file and line where that error occurred.
If used correctly, this will be the exact location in your code where something has first
gone wrong. (I say "if used correctly" because if you only wrap some of your critical calls, and
the error is in an unwrapped call, then `dbgcheck` cannot detect that error.)
In addition most (but currently not all) error detection is synchronous so that breakpoints can
be placed within `dbgcheck.c` to provide a way to either print a stack trace or use an
interactive debugger to gain insight into the error.

## Memory checks

### Theory

At a very high level, only two things can go wrong with memory. Either you try to access an address
that isn't allocated, or you run out of it.

If we treat all memory operations as byte-level reads or writes, then we can recategorize all
possible errors like so:

* computing an invalid address,
* copying a too-large block to a given destination, or
* using too much memory.

*(Some low-level programs may also run into problems with aliasing, where a copy operation has been
performed in an incorrect order causing a loss of data. From our byte-operation perspective, an
aliasing error is not considered a low-level memory management problem.)*

This categorization makes sense in terms of `malloc` and `free` since every allocated block is an
island, and the only valid pointers within that block must be always be ultimately derived from
the starting address of that block. Hence the only way to arrive at an invalid address is to either
not use a valid starting address, or to add an invalid offset to a valid starting address.

### Practice

Internally, `dbgcheck` adds additional bookkeeping to track memory references.
When you allocate a block with `dbgcheck`, slightly more memory than you requested is actually
allocated, and a block prefix is used to track the size of the block. `malloc` independently tracks
block sizes, but `dbgcheck` is specifically designed to assume nothing beyond the formally
specified behavior of `malloc`.

Whenever you want to access memory using a pointer, you have the option of asking `dbgcheck` to
verify the validity of your pointer. This works by classifying pointers as either
*root pointers* or *inner pointers*. A root pointer points to the beginning of an allocated block;
in other words, it is the return value from `dbgcheck__malloc` or any of the other `dbgcheck`-based
allocating functions (the others wrap `strdup` and `calloc`). An inner pointer may point anywhere
within an allocated block or to the byte directly after the end of the allocated block.
This last case is useful for performing conditional checks of the form `my_ptr < block_end_ptr`,
and is a legal C pointer value.

Suppose you want to copy a string into an allocated block. To check the validity of the copy,
`dbgcheck` asks you to provide the root pointer of the destination, the number of bytes about to
be copied, and the destination pointer if it's not the same as the root pointer. Since `dbgcheck`
can determine the full valid range of the destination block, this is sufficient to know exactly
whether or not the copy operation is valid.

In a sense, this kind of check is analogous to the difference between `strcpy` and `strncpy`.
The difference is that `dbgcheck` can help you to verify that the value of *n* you provide
matches the available memory at the destination.

When a block is deallocated `dbgcheck` does something a little crazy, which is that it does *not*
free the memory - it simply marks it so that it will know the memory has been freed. For those of
you freaking out about your memory disappearing, please understand that this element of `dbgcheck`
is designed for small use cases to help you isolate errors. In production, undefine the
`dbgcheck_on` macro before including `dbgcheck.h`, which turns off this feature.

By leaving blocks allocated, `dbgcheck` is extremely likely to detect double-frees and
access-after-free errors.

This methodology gives us a way to
check for any of the three major categories of memory errors. The technical details of
using `dbgcheck` to achieve this are covered in the API section below.

## Threading checks

### Theory

There are two major bugs that can occur in multithreaded code:

* Two sections of code intended to never run concurrently
  may run concurrently, or
* a thread may become stuck waiting forever on a lock.

The first category of bug is difficult to check automatically, since the decision of which sections of code are not meant to
run concurrently is nontrivial. The `dbgcheck` library does not
attempt to solve this problem, but instead helps to clarify and
verify the concurrency rules set up by the programmer;
`dbgcheck` can also provide some checks against low-level lock
usage errors. These checks are described in the next
section.

Another relevant idea is *lock nesting*: we say that lock
*A* nests outside lock *B* when some code locks *B* while *A*
is already locked. A deadlock between *A* and *B* can occur if
they nest outside each other.
More generally, we can create a directed *nesting graph*
between locks where node *A* is connected to *B*
(*A* â†’ *B*) when *A* nests outside *B*. Then a deadlock between
these locks can only occur if this graph contains a cycle.

The `dbgcheck` library does not currently know about lock
nesting behavior or graphs beyond trivial cases. However,
it is good design to think and communicate clearly about
lock nesting behavior.
